# AAE6102 - GNSS Opensourced tools

## Introduction  
Welcome to the **AAE6102 Laboratory**!  
This lab is designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of GNSS data processing using open-source libraries and datasets. The primary goal is to familiarize students with the GNSS processing procedures, including data acquisition, preprocessing, and analysis.  

This repository contains materials and resources that will assist students in conducting the lab exercises and preparing their reports. It includes sample datasets, useful scripts, reference documents, and links to open-source GNSS libraries commonly used in research and industry.  

## Lab Objectives  
- Understand the basic concepts and processing steps involved in GNSS data analysis.  
- Gain hands-on experience with open-source GNSS libraries and tools.  
- Learn how to process raw GNSS data and generate meaningful results.  
- Develop skills in analyzing GNSS performance and accuracy.  

## Materials
### Libraries
Choose one open-source GNSS library that is available from the Internet, the following list are some examples:
#### RTKLIB (GUI)
#### RTKLIB (C/C++)

### Dataset
Choose one or more datasets to test the library, here are some examples:


## Report Submission
Report and results should be submitted on a group created GitHub repository. And the report should be written in README file.
